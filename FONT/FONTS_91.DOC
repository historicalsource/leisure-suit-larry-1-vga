                     ...dedicated to all those who use 
                   (and abuse) fonts on a regular basis...



Attempting to organize the mass of fonts that have been developed
over the past 4 years, we came up with the following naming convention:
the thousands digit indicates the type; the hundreds digit indicates
the font; and the last two digits indicate the height in pixels. 
Therefore, font number 1208 is a san serif font 8 pixels tall.

1000 fonts -- SAN SERIF 
2000 fonts -- SERIF 
3000 fonts -- SCRIPT
4000 fonts -- BLOCK 
5000 fonts -- DECORATIVE 
6000 fonts -- HEADLINE 

SERIFS are the teensy-weensy lines at the tops and bottoms of some 
letters.  SAN SERIF are fonts without serifs ("san" being from the 
Latin, "Sansabelt" or "Jaymar Ruby").  LEADING is the white space
between lines of type (the more lead, the farther apart the lines
are).  A short font history will follow (much later).


A complete list follows:
