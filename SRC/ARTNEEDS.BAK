BILL:
v120 
door last cel sticks in between the drunk's legs.  Look at it during
	a room change going to r130 (Lefty's bathroom).  Adjust please.


r380
BILL we still need a button to turn bubbles on and off in closeup of Eve, 385
	you may alter MY v385, L4    AL

fix bubbles in tub to run efficiently.  Look at view. You'll see.
	include center of tub in perimeter or Something?



mouthNose cursor
	I know you've worked on this, but the cursor still doesn't match the
	icon in the iconBar.  Make cursor look like icon (not other way around,
	OK?)


r500
outside the store, talking on the telephone with the tongue hanging out
	could be useful now.  Have you got backups?  If not, find out view number
	and we'll get Chris to restore off old network backups.  (Try out the
	555-6969 number for fun, too. AND, go buy a lubber.  Watch ego head!)



PLEASE REMOVE, CORRECT, FIX, ETC. those extra views in the view dir.
	You know, 140B.v56 and on and on....
